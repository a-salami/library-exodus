                <p>My name is Allison. <b>This is my library.</b> Every book I see fit to remain amongst my physical selection is proudly displayed here. Not all of these books are my favorite. I did not enjoy all of them. But that's the best part, no? Literature is a gift.</p>
                <p>One never knows what one might get when a book's first pages flutter open.</p>
                <p>We welcome the new and the old, the scent of a fresh-cracked binding or of time-weathered pages. Here, a few words are worth a thousand pictures, if only they're in the right order.</p>
                <p>Now, <a href = "pages/look-books.html">go look for books</a>!</p>
